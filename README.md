# Clothing Predictor Trained on a Deep Neural Network
Artificial Intelligence (CS 540) project at UW-Madison using Pytorch. Creates and trains a neural network that labels images of clothing. Trained on the FashionMNIST dataset from Pytorch.

```
```

Model is built and trained using intro_pytorch.py, then the model is evaluated using mini_grader.py. I only wrote intro_pytorch.py, not the mini_grader.py file.
